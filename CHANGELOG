[v30.6] - 2025-05-20 (Latest Stable)

Fixed

Critical Reference Error: Fixed ReferenceError: App is not defined by correcting component scope and syntax structure in the un-minified code.

Robust Name Normalization: Updated the normalizeName regex logic to aggressively ignore whitespace around quotation marks.

Scenario: 1/2” C-Flex and 1/2”C-Flex are now treated as identical, preventing "Unassignable" errors caused by minor typo differences between Catalog and Patterns.

Global Error Handler: Added window.onerror to capture and alert runtime errors, preventing "White Screen of Death" silent failures.

[v30.3] - 2025-05-20

Fixed

Strict Data Synchronization: Performed a character-by-character sync between DEFAULT_CATALOG and DEFAULT_AUTOCLAVE_PATTERNS.

Specific Typo Fixes:

Fixed SOP No.6 (1/2”C- Flex-1/2”) incorrectly defaulting to Pattern 1 due to an extra space in Pattern 5's rule.

Fixed SOP No.3 (3/8”Silicone) appearing as unassignable due to a missing space in the catalog vs pattern.

[v30.0] - 2025-05-20

Added

Backtracking Algorithm (Optimizer): Replaced the simple Greedy algorithm with a Backtracking with Branch & Bound strategy.

Benefit: The system now actively searches for the combination that yields the minimum total sterilization cycles, rather than just filling the first available slot.

Fallback: Includes a performance threshold (MAX_ITERATIONS) to fallback to Greedy mode for extremely large datasets to prevent browser freezing.

[v29.2] - 2025-05-19

Fixed

Data mismatch (Unassignable Items): Fixed issues where 3/8" C-Flex items were rejected by the autoclave calculator due to mismatching spaces in the naming convention (e.g., Type Z removal leftovers).

[v29.1] - 2025-05-19

Fixed

React Key Duplication: Fixed console errors caused by duplicate keys in dropdown menus.

Cause: Normalizing names (removing "Type X") resulted in duplicate entries for React to render.

Fix: Implemented Set based deduplication for all dropdown options.

[v29.0] - 2025-05-19

Changed

State Lifting: Lifted manualCart state from AutoclaveModule to the main App component.

Benefit: Users no longer lose their manually added items (forceps, valves, etc.) when switching between tabs (e.g., from Calc back to Planner).

Performance: Wrapped calculation logic in useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Added

Include Stock Option: Added a checkbox to optionally allow "Stock" items from the Planner to be imported into the Sterilization queue (default is strictly Custom Assembly items only).

[v28.0] - 2025-05-18

Added

Full Pattern Restoration: Restored all 10 autoclave patterns (Patterns 1-10) which were partially missing in the initial merge.

Complex Constraints: Ported the "Advanced Rules" logic (e.g., "Max 2 Scissors per zone") from the legacy v13 calculator.

Group B Restoration: Restored the full list of auxiliary equipment (Group B).

[v27.0] - 2025-05-17 (Initial Merge)

Added

Integration: Successfully merged Tubing Planner v26.0 and Autoclave Calculator v13.0 into a single HTML file.

Unified Database: Established data flow where Planner assignments automatically populate the Autoclave queue.

File System: Unified JSON Export/Import system for both tools.
