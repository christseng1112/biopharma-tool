Change Log - Integrated Tool

[v29.1] - 2025-05-20

Fixed

React Key Duplication Error:

Fixed a critical console error where duplicate keys were generated in the <select> dropdowns within AutoclaveModule.

This occurred because normalization (removing "Type Z" suffixes) caused different catalog items to have identical display names.

Implementation: Added [...new Set(...)] deduplication logic to groupAItems, groupBItems, and DEFAULT_AUTOCLAVE_PATTERNS initialization.

[v29.0] - 2025-05-19

Added

State Persistence: Lifted manualCart state from AutoclaveModule to the main App component. Manual entries now survive tab switching.

Stock Inclusion Toggle: Added a checkbox in the Autoclave tab to optionally include "Stock" items from the Planner in the sterilization queue.

Optimization: Wrapped the heavy greedy scheduling algorithm in useMemo to improve performance and prevent infinite render loops caused by useEffect.

[v28.0] - 2025-05-18

Merged

Full Pattern Restoration: Restored all 10 autoclave patterns (including Pattern 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10) which were missing in the initial merge.

Complex Logic Port: Successfully ported the "Advanced Constraints" logic (nested rules for sub-limits within zones) from the original v13 calculator.

Group B Restoration: Restored the full list of Group B items (Equipment & Parts).

[v27.0] - 2025-05-17

Initial Merge

Combined Tubing Planner v26.0 and Autoclave Calculator v13.0.

Unified database structure (Planner assignments feed into Autoclave queue).

Removed dependency on localStorage for Autoclave, now using the unified JSON config export.
